By the end of this experiment, participants will be able to:

1. **Understand the fundamental concepts of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** and their application in natural language processing, particularly for POS tagging.

2. **Identify and differentiate between transition probabilities and emission probabilities** in the context of HMMs for POS tagging.

3. **Calculate and interpret transition matrices** that model the likelihood of moving from one POS tag to another in a sequence.

4. **Calculate and interpret emission matrices** that model the likelihood of observing specific words given particular POS tags.

5. **Apply the Viterbi algorithm** to find the most likely sequence of POS tags for a given sentence using HMM parameters.

6. **Analyze the step-by-step process** of HMM-based POS tagging, including initialization, forward computation, and backtracking.

7. **Evaluate the impact of different probability values** on the final POS tagging results through interactive manipulation.

8. **Compare and contrast** the performance of HMM-based POS tagging on different sentence structures and word types.

9. **Understand the role of context** in disambiguating POS tags for words that can have multiple grammatical functions.
