### Advanced Topics in Markov Models and POS Tagging

#### 1. Markov Model Variants

- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** Learn how HMMs are used for sequence labeling tasks like POS tagging.
- **Higher-Order Markov Models:** Explore trigram and n-gram models for capturing longer dependencies.
- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):** Study CRFs as an extension for structured prediction.

#### 2. Sequence Labeling in NLP

- Compare HMMs, CRFs, and neural sequence models for POS tagging.
- Study applications in named entity recognition and chunking.
- Analyze challenges in tagging ambiguous and rare words.

#### 3. Computational Implementation

- Algorithms for training and decoding (Viterbi, Forward-Backward).
- Efficient storage and computation for large tagsets.
- Handling data sparsity and smoothing techniques.
